    description: The aim of this project is to offer a streamlined and user-friendly solution to monitor server hardware and usage info from the server users' viewpoint. Most of the application is built using bash scripts, enabling simple execution and integration with existing server management workflows. For storing the gathered hardware and usage data, a Relational Database Management System is utilized, with PostgreSQL (psql) as the selected database technology. To simplify deployment and isolation, the project is implemented within a Docker container. The development progress is tracked using Git version control.

    # The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: "Proposed a novel Machine Learning-based image inpainting framework that can progressively recover corrupted images while maintaining their structural and contextual feature integrity. Implemented the proposed model using PyTorch and conducted extensive experiments on large datasets (100,000 samples) for performance comparison. Analyzed the data obtained from ablation studies to evaluate the individual contributions of each sub-model on the overall performance of the proposed method."
  - name: "Canonical Correlation Analysis for Object Retrieval"
    #git_url: 
    description: "Applied Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) on the image features extracted from a pretrained CNN on Tensorflow for image retrieval. Utilized Statistical Hypothesis Testing to evaluate image similarities. Evaluated the retrieval performance in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) using MATLAB. Conducted statistical analysis using Python to uncover insights and trends from the data Compared with PCA and LDA-based approaches, the proposed showed better performance and higher robustness to dimensionality reduction."
