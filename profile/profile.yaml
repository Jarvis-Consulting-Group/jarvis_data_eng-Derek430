    description: The aim of this project is to offer a streamlined and user-friendly solution to monitor server hardware and usage info from the server users' viewpoint. Most of the application is built using bash scripts, enabling simple execution and integration with existing server management workflows. For storing the gathered hardware and usage data, a Relational Database Management System is utilized, with PostgreSQL (psql) as the selected database technology. To simplify deployment and isolation, the project is implemented within a Docker container. The development progress is tracked using Git version control.
